		<h1>Digital Art</h1></a>
		<img class= "paintingimg1" src="beaheded_edi.jpg" alt="Scraping">
				<p> Digital art uses computers and graphic devices to distort, represent and re-create images in an alternative way. This week we learned to use Photoshop to modify traditional works using out own personal perspectives. Whilst it was engaging, the process was tedious and probably to difficult for primary students. Nevertheless, the use of ICT in the classroom is reflected in the teaching syllabus outcomes.</p> 
				<br>
		<h5>How could this be used in the classroom?</h5>
				<p> Students are required to use ICT to compete projects. Although we used Photoshop in the lesson, basic drawing programs such as Autodesk Sketchbook could be used by children for simple digital artwork. Similarlythe process of cutting and layering could be emulated physically with the use of photographs and different backgrounds. Children could cut out their images and place them on difference backgrounds or in different pictures, to grasp a conceptual understanding of layering. </p>

		<h1>Painting</h1></a>
		<img class= "paintingimg" src="painting 3.jpg" alt="Palette">
	<p> Painting is often the most simple way to intitiate children to art. Holding a brush in hand, mising colors until and impossibly greenish-brown is reached and the paint seems to be on every part of their hands and faces. It is one of the most common forms of classroom display art, and is therefore introduced when students are fairly young, in kindergarten or even preschool. Although children cannot fully grasp its techniques, they slowly build minor paint manipulation skills. 
		<br>
	During our exploration of painting techniques, we looked at Primary, Secondary and Tertairy colours. Each of these colour sets presents a different painting style and palette, and also introduced us to the color wheel. The use of opposing colours creates a highlighting and subduing effect, when used intentionally. We also looked at form and style: reflecting on traditional painting techniques for out self-portrait work. We started from a orange background, which is reflective of traditional European landscape painting, which began on a background of Sienna or Burnt Sienna, depending on the artists intentions and avalibility. We looked at traditional representation techniques and how these can be enforces with drawing guides. And Finally we stepped away from European representation structures to look at Eastern, particually Middle Eastern, painting styles. This style favoures representationalisum as well as symbolisum. 
		<br>
		<h5>How can this be implimented in a classroom?</h5>
		Perhaps a better question would be, how can we escape painting in the classroom? Its a great style and easy to prepare for students, but can be used way too often if not careful. It woud be helpful to teach students some facial drawing guides to help them represent facial features more accurately. Students could also learn the Primary and Secondary colour mixing techniques.

		<h1>Sculpture</h1></a>
	<img class= "paintingimg1" src="sculpture_main_edi.jpg" alt="Scraping">
	<p> Sculpture assemblage peels away from traditional paper-representation art: it allows the artist the build <i>with</i> form and <i>from</i> form. In our assembly process, we built sculptures from found objects: a process used and well-respected by many professional artists. It allows the artist, and the students as artists, to create art with phycial mass and structure.
		<br>
		<h5>Ideas for the Classroom</h5>
			<p> Students love to build, whether its Lego or simply stacking blocks. Sculpture could be use din the classroom to visualise a solution to a problem, or to work through a specific unit of work that could require modelling. Students could be asked to bring in materials that can be shared around: because any found object can we a tool for construction. </p>

	<h5 class="lefttitle">Tips for Ceramics</h5>
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use slurry (a wet mixture of old clay) for joins</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Make sure the clay is no thicker than 2 cm</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Roll out clay to remove air pockets and bubbles</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Make sure all hollow shapes have a hole to allow air to escape</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Keep clay damp, apply small amounts of water so it doesn't dry out</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Make sure the clay isn't too thin or the pieces will fall off!</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wrap in glad-wrap to avoid drying out, if pieces aren't finished.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	<h5>Starting Out</h5>
		<p>
		Starting with a basic shape, Ceramics builds detail from form. Understanding the properties of the material is the most important part. Clay that is thicker than 2 cm will blow in the kiln. Make sure that all hollow shapes have a hole to let air escape.
			<br>

	<h5 class="lefttitle">Making a Sphere</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Start with a circular ball of clay, rounded in the hands by repeat pressing, or other techniques to round it.</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Halve the shape with a wire tool, splitting the shape into two semi-circles.</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Hollow out each half of the circle, making a cup shape in the hands so the circular, spherical shape isn't lost.</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- When both halves are hollowed, scratch at the flattened edges and apply slurry to rejoin the shape.</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Roll and press the shape so it rejoins, smoothing out the edges to hide the join.</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Make a small hole in one section of allow air to escape in the kiln.</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wrap in glad-wrap to avoid drying out, if pieces aren't finished.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Still Life</h1></a>
	<img class= "paintingimg1" src="StillLifeMain.jpg" alt="Scraping">
	<p> Looking at the subject and trying to break down and capture it's shape; that is the role of still life art. It's imitation of form and conversation of cultural and modern ideas. Taking form and breaking it down into smaller, manageable shapes. 
	Sketching out
	<br>
	Initially we sketch out basic shapes and ideas which will come to form the more detailed piece. Look and observe what you can see- don't draw what you think should be there. 
	<br>
	Fleshing in Detail. After getting the basic shape, we looked at ideas of light, shade, colour, chiaroscuro and balance. How are the shapes and volumes represented? What can you see? Is there a label or writing, maybe some patterns of detail?
	<br>
	Finishing the piece. To finish off the piece, depending on the type of work, it may need a fixative to seal the medium. </p>
		<h5>Implimenting in the classroom</h5>
	<p>Students can look sta objects and shapes in the classroom and try to represent these on paper using different materials. Get children to focus on what they are seeing, not what they expect. Having a visual and spacial understanding of form allows for a more precise re-creation of the object. </p>

		<h1>Techniques</h1></a>
		<img class= "paintingimg" src="techniques5.jpg" alt="Scraping">
	<p> When we draw, we utilise experience and technique to inform our representations. Artists often use references or inspiration to fuel their artmaking. In out technique practice, we utilised a few different materials and mediums to represent scenes. We explored a diverse range of techniques of representation to borarden our understanding of drawing in practice. 
		<br>
	<h5>Implimenting Drawing Techniques in the Classroom</h5>
	<p>Drawing techniques can be used in the classroom to introduce children to different mediums and ways of representing. By asking students to re-create objects and use observational skills, this builds on their conceptual understanding of mass, colidity and volume. </p>
